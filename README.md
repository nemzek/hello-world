# hello-world

Hey, this is my first Github readme so that I can actually learn to use Github and begin to gain some semblance of value as an individual searching for a job in the software world. 
Hopefully no potential employers read this, but if they do, I pray they have a sense of humor. Rather, I pray they like MY sense of humor.
Maybe I should really rename this a DONTREADME file. That would be a bit more accurate.
Anyways, I think I'll stop ranting now.
Thank you for your time.
